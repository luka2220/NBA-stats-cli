# Nba Statistics Applications
* A CLI application that displays NBA statistics for league leaders, players, and teams from current or previous seasons
* My purpose and motivation in building this project is to learn and get a better understanding of:
 - Implementing software design principles in go
 - Become familiar with the net/http library and making HTTP requests
 - Understand how to read and store HTTP byte slice responses with the encoding/json library

## Project Setup
1. Clone the repo on your system
2. Download the necessary packages:
